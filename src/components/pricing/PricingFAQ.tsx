    question: "How does Synth keep usage predictable?",
    answer:
      "Synth uses soft caps and cost-control levers instead of hard per-task pricing. You'll always know what you're paying before the bill arrives. When you approach your automation limit, we notify you early so you can add a Capacity Pack or adjust workflows — no surprises, no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I hit my automation cap?",
    answer:
      "You'll receive early warnings as you approach your monthly limit. When you hit the cap, you can instantly add a Capacity Pack to continue running automations without interruption. Your workflows never stop unexpectedly — you stay in control.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why don't you charge per task like Zapier?",
    answer:
      "Per-task pricing punishes power users and creates anxiety around automation. Synth uses AI planning to execute workflows more efficiently — often completing in fewer steps what others require many tasks for. This means more power for less, with predictable costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch plans anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Upgrading is instant — your new features and capacity become available immediately. Downgrading takes effect at the end of your current billing period. No penalties, no hassle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Done-For-You required?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. Done-For-You is completely optional but highly recommended if you want expert-built automations from day one. Our team handles everything from business intake to full workflow implementation, QA, and ongoing optimization.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my integrations secure?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. All credentials are encrypted and isolated per user. We never share access between accounts, and our infrastructure follows enterprise-grade security standards. Your data and connections remain private and protected.",
  },
